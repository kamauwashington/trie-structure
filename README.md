# Trie Structure in TypeScript

> This repository is purely for reference and is illustrative in it is purpose. This is one of the many ways of implementing this algorithm, but represents a vanilla implementation without any additional packages.


This project illustrates an implementation of a Trie or Prefix-Tree structure [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) in TypeScript with implementations of inserting, searching, suggestions, and deleting.

A **Trie** (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and search for words or sequences, especially when working with prefixes. Each node represents a character, and paths through the tree spell out words. For example, in a Trie storing "cat," "car," and "cart," the first three nodes would share the common prefix "ca." Tries are great for autocomplete, dictionary storage, and prefix-based searching because they allow quick lookups by following the path of characters.


## Trie Examples

* **Dictionary Storage**: A Trie can store words like "apple," "apply," and "apt," efficiently organizing them by their common prefixes.
* **Phone Directory**: A Trie can store contacts like "John," "Johnny," and "Joanna," enabling fast lookups starting with "Jo."
* **IP Routing**: In network systems, a Trie can store and search IP address prefixes for routing decisions.

## Trie Visualization

A Trie is an efficient data structure for storing and searching strings allowing word operations to be performed in O(n) time, where n is the length of the word, regardless of the number of words stored.

* **IN BLUE** Given the words **albany, album, alice** a Trie search for **album** searches for by walking
    * a -> l -> b -> u -> m _instead of_ searching through the 3 words for a match
* **IN GREEN** Given the words **bob, book, born** a Trie search for **book** searches for by walking
    * b -> o -> o -> k _instead of_ searching through the 3 words for a match
